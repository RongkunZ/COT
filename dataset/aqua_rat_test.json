If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)\n\nOptions:\nA)3\nB)4\nC)5\nD)10\nE)20\n\nPrevious Steps:\nStep 1: The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters.\nStep 2: In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).\nStep 3: At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.\nStep 4: Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test.\nStep 5: (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)\nAs a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers.\nStep 6: Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.\n\nNext Step:",
